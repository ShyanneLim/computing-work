Bob was home **all alone**, watching the television.
The news reporter was describing the profile of a **murderer**, who was on the loose.
He shifted his gaze to the sliding glassdoors leading to his backyard, and noticed *someone* standing out in the snow. 
He fitted the profile of the murderer. And he *smiled* at Bob. 
Gulping, Bob picked up the phone next to him and dialed for 999 with trembling hands.
He turned his head towards the glassdoor again as he pressed the phone to his ear. 
That *someone* was coming closer. Slowly but surely. 
Then, Bob's phone **dropped**.
His mouth was agape, as he realised that there were no footprints in the snow. 
It was his own *reflection* 
Suddenly, the reflection started moving closer... and closer... 
Bob stood there, his legs refusing to move upon command...
then, he realised that the image was virtual as it was his reflection and when he turned around,    
he realised he was watching....fox news.
as he started to understand what was really happening, he realised it was probably caused
by the guy he actually murdered yesterday. Whew! now that that's over, he went to bed.
this story is a fail THANKS:>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
